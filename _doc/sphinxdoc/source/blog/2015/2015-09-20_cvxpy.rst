    After I installed `CVXcanon <https://github.com/cvxgrp/CVXcanon>`_ (see previous blog), 
    I went through an issue
    ``canonInterface`` is not found.
    I corrected with the following modification:
    `change import instruction to use CVXcanon explicitely  <https://github.com/sdpython/cvxpy/commit/11fe2bff21cbafcb694cab1265f111e6f9314ac4>`_.
