    On the way to build a setup for my student,
    I went through an issue with the packages 
    `futures <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/futures>`_,
    version 3.0.3 which contains the following line::

        raise type(self._exception), self._exception, self._traceback

    It raises an exception *SyntaxError* from file
    `_base.py <https://github.com/agronholm/pythonfutures/blob/master/concurrent/futures/_base.py>`_.
    I checked with an older version (2.2.0) and this line
    does not appear. Let's follow
    `Issue 41 <https://github.com/agronholm/pythonfutures/issues/41>`_.
