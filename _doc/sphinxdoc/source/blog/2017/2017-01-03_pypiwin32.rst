    The module `pypiwin32 <https://github.com/pywin32/pypiwin32>`_ does not seem to
    be refreshed on `PyPi <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pypiwin32/>`_.
    To compile it, you need to get the sources from 
    `pypiwin32 <https://github.com/pywin32/pypiwin32>`_,
    to install `Windows SDK <https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk>`_
    if you did not already (not sure that is required but just in case).
    
    Set up the environment variable ``MSSdk`` to the location
    of the Microsoft SDK. In my case, it was:
    
    ::
    
        set MSSdk=C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.1A
        
    Change ``from distutils.core import setup`` into
    ``from setuptools import setup`` to be able to build
    a wheel.
