    New version of Python and the same issues come back
    when I need to compile some specific packages such as pycrypto.
    No big issue here. After getting the sources, the following
    instructions might work:
    
    ::
    
        python setup.py bdist_wheel
        
    In my case, I got:
    
    ::
    
        C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\include\10.0.10240.0\ucrt\inttypes.h(26): error C2061: syntax error: identifier 'intmax_t'
        
    I finally decided to edit this file and to add just before the line
    of the error (which I'll remove after):
    
    ::
    
        #define intmax_t long long
        #define uintmax_t unsigned long long
    
    And I was able to build ``pycrypto-2.7a2-cp36-cp36m-win_amd64.whl``.
