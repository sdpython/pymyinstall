    It does not work unless you install the missing
    parts. Python 3.6 is compiled with Visual Studio 2015
    and this specific compiler needs to be installed.
    There is a way with 2017, instructions are provided at
    `Creating a C++ extension for Python <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/python/cpp-and-python>`_.
    I copy paste the line:

        If you're using Visual Studio 2017, run the Visual Studio installer,
        select Modify, select Individual Components > Compilers,
        build tools, and runtimes > Visual C++ 2015.3 v140 toolset.
        This step is necessary because Python (for Windows) is itself
        built with Visual Studio 2015 (version 14.0) and expects that
        those tools are available when building an extension through
        the method described here.

    I recommand using 
    `Python 3.6.3 <https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-363/>`_
    because of this change
    `Issue 30389 <https://bugs.python.org/issue30389>`_
    (*distutils._msvccompiler cannot find VS 2017*).
