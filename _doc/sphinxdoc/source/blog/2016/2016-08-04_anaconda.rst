    I'm heavily using virtual environment to test my modules
    on multiple configuration. Anaconda has been failing
    for six months. I did not find a way to create a virtual 
    environment. I let some updates go through. I don't remember
    why it failed but right now it is just because
    I create a virtual environment on disk D 
    but Anaconda is installed on disk C.
    This is explained but this 
    `issue <https://github.com/conda/conda/issues/3198>`_.
